# Note: There appears to be a bug in stow 2.4.1 where new directory symlinks
# (like nvim and vim) are not created even though stow reports success.
# The init.sh script includes a workaround that manually creates these symlinks.
#
# Stow correctly handles:
# - starship.toml (file symlink)
# - Files inside existing directories (e.g., lazygit/config.yml)
#
# Stow fails to create:
# - nvim directory symlink (reports "LINK: nvim" but doesn't create it)
# - vim directory symlink (reports "LINK: vim" but doesn't create it)
#
# This has been worked around in init.sh with manual ln -s commands.
