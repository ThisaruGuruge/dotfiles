## Database and key paths (using defaults)
# db_path = "~/.local/share/atuin/history.db"
# key_path = "~/.local/share/atuin/key"
# session_path = "~/.local/share/atuin/session"

## Date format: "us" (MM/DD) or "uk" (DD/MM)
dialect = "us"

## Timezone for displaying time
timezone = "local"

## Sync settings (enable if you want cross-machine history)
# auto_sync = true
# sync_address = "https://api.atuin.sh"
# sync_frequency = "10m"

## Update check
update_check = true

# ============================================================================
# Search Configuration
# ============================================================================

## Search mode: prefix, fulltext, fuzzy, skim
## fuzzy is recommended for most flexible matching
search_mode = "fuzzy"

## Default filter mode: global, host, session, directory, workspace
## global searches all history, directory is great for project-specific commands
filter_mode = "global"

## Enable workspace filtering (filter within git repository trees)
## Great for project-specific command recall
workspaces = true

## Up-arrow behavior: use prefix search for intuitive command recall
## This shows matching commands as you type the beginning of a command
filter_mode_shell_up_key_binding = "host"
search_mode_shell_up_key_binding = "prefix"

# ============================================================================
# UI Configuration
# ============================================================================

## Style: auto, full, compact
style = "auto"

## Inline height (0 = full screen, or set a specific height)
inline_height = 0

## Up-arrow uses compact inline view
inline_height_shell_up_key_binding = 40

## Invert UI (search bar at top)
invert = false

## Show command preview (useful for long commands)
show_preview = true

## What to do on escape: return-original or return-query
exit_mode = "return-original"

## possible values: emacs, subl
# word_jump_mode = "emacs"

## characters that count as a part of a word
# word_chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"

## number of context lines to show when scrolling by pages
# scroll_context_lines = 1

## use ctrl instead of alt as the shortcut modifier key for numerical UI shortcuts
## alt-0 .. alt-9
# ctrl_n_shortcuts = false

## default history list format - can also be specified with the --format arg
# history_format = "{time}\t{command}\t{duration}"

## prevent commands matching any of these regexes from being written to history.
## Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't start
## with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in the command.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see
## https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax
# history_filter = [
#   "^secret-cmd",
#   "^innocuous-cmd .*--secret=.+",
# ]

## prevent commands run with cwd matching any of these regexes from being written
## to history. Note that these regular expressions are unanchored, i.e. if they don't
## start with ^ or end with $, they'll match anywhere in CWD.
## For details on the supported regular expression syntax, see
## https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax
# cwd_filter = [
#   "^/very/secret/area",
# ]

## Configure the maximum height of the preview to show.
## Useful when you have long scripts in your history that you want to distinguish
## by more than the first few lines.
# max_preview_height = 4

## Configure whether or not to show the help row, which includes the current Atuin
## version (and whether an update is available), a keymap hint, and the total
## amount of commands in your history.
# show_help = true

## Configure whether or not to show tabs for search and inspect
# show_tabs = true

## Configure whether or not the tabs row may be auto-hidden, which includes the current Atuin
## tab, such as Search or Inspector, and other tabs you may wish to see. This will
## only be hidden if there are fewer than this count of lines available, and does not affect the use
## of keyboard shortcuts to switch tab. 0 to never auto-hide, default is 8 (lines).
## This is ignored except in `compact` mode.
# auto_hide_height = 8

## Defaults to true. This matches history against a set of default regex, and will not save it if we get a match. Defaults include
## 1. AWS key id
## 2. Github pat (old and new)
## 3. Slack oauth tokens (bot, user)
## 4. Slack webhooks
## 5. Stripe live/test keys
# secrets_filter = true

## Defaults to true. If enabled, upon hitting enter Atuin will immediately execute the command. Press tab to return to the shell and edit.
# This applies for new installs. Old installs will keep the old behaviour unless configured otherwise.
enter_accept = true

## Defaults to false. If enabled, when triggered after && or ||, Atuin will complete commands to chain rather than replace the current line.
# command_chaining = false

## Defaults to "emacs".  This specifies the keymap on the startup of `atuin
## search`.  If this is set to "auto", the startup keymap mode in the Atuin
## search is automatically selected based on the shell's keymap where the
## keybinding is defined.  If this is set to "emacs", "vim-insert", or
## "vim-normal", the startup keymap mode in the Atuin search is forced to be
## the specified one.
# keymap_mode = "auto"

## Cursor style in each keymap mode.  If specified, the cursor style is changed
## in entering the cursor shape.  Available values are "default" and
## "{blink,steady}-{block,underline,bar}".
# keymap_cursor = { emacs = "blink-block", vim_insert = "blink-block", vim_normal = "steady-block" }

# network_connect_timeout = 5
# network_timeout = 5

## Timeout (in seconds) for acquiring a local database connection (sqlite)
# local_timeout = 5

## Set this to true and Atuin will minimize motion in the UI - timers will not update live, etc.
## Alternatively, set env NO_MOTION=true
# prefers_reduced_motion = false

[stats]
## Track subcommands for better statistics (e.g., "git commit" vs just "git")
common_subcommands = [
  "bal",
  "brew",
  "cargo",
  "docker",
  "git",
  "go",
  "gradle",
  "kubectl",
  "npm",
  "pnpm",
  "tmux",
  "yarn",
]

## Strip these prefixes when computing stats
common_prefix = ["sudo"]

## Ignore these trivial commands from stats
ignored_commands = [
  "cd",
  "ls",
  "ll",
  "clear",
  "exit",
]

[keys]
# Defaults to true. If disabled, using the up/down key won't exit the TUI when scrolled past the first/last entry.
# scroll_exits = true
# Defaults to true. The left arrow key will exit the TUI when scrolling before the first character
# exit_past_line_start = true
# Defaults to true. The right arrow key performs the same functionality as Tab and copies the selected line to the command line to be modified.
# accept_past_line_end = true

[sync]
# Enable sync v2 by default
# This ensures that sync v2 is enabled for new installs only
# In a later release it will become the default across the board
records = true

[preview]
## which preview strategy to use to calculate the preview height (respects max_preview_height).
## possible values: auto, static
## auto: length of the selected command.
## static: length of the longest command stored in the history.
## fixed: use max_preview_height as fixed height.
# strategy = "auto"

[daemon]
## Enables using the daemon to sync. Requires the daemon to be running in the background. Start it with `atuin daemon`
# enabled = false

## How often the daemon should sync in seconds
# sync_frequency = 300

## The path to the unix socket used by the daemon (on unix systems)
## linux/mac: ~/.local/share/atuin/atuin.sock
## windows: Not Supported
# socket_path = "~/.local/share/atuin/atuin.sock"

## Use systemd socket activation rather than opening the given path (the path must still be correct for the client)
## linux: false
## mac/windows: Not Supported
# systemd_socket = false

## The port that should be used for TCP on non unix systems
# tcp_port = 8889

# [theme]
## Color theme to use for rendering in the terminal.
## There are some built-in themes, including the base theme ("default"),
## "autumn" and "marine". You can add your own themes to the "./themes" subdirectory of your
## Atuin config (or ATUIN_THEME_DIR, if provided) as TOML files whose keys should be one or
## more of AlertInfo, AlertWarn, AlertError, Annotation, Base, Guidance, Important, and
## the string values as lowercase entries from this list:
##    https://ogeon.github.io/docs/palette/master/palette/named/index.html
## If you provide a custom theme file, it should be  called "NAME.toml" and the theme below
## should be the stem, i.e. `theme = "NAME"` for your chosen NAME.
# name = "autumn"

## Whether the theme manager should output normal or extra information to help fix themes.
## Boolean, true or false. If unset, left up to the theme manager.
# debug = true

[search]
## Filter modes in order (Tab to cycle through them)
## workspace: commands in current git repo; directory: current dir only
## Putting workspace/directory first makes project context easily accessible
filters = [ "global", "host", "session", "directory", "workspace" ]
