## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome in several forms:

1. **Bug Reports** - Report issues you encounter
2. **Feature Requests** - Suggest new features or improvements
3. **Code Contributions** - Submit pull requests with fixes or enhancements
4. **Documentation** - Improve or expand documentation
5. **Testing** - Test on different systems and report results

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS (primary target platform)
- Git
- Homebrew
- Zsh shell

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
   cd ~/dotfiles
   ```

3. Add upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ThisaruGuruge/dotfiles.git
   ```

4. Create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a pull request, test your changes:

```bash
# Run validation suite
./bin/test-zsh-config

# Test shell syntax
zsh -n zsh/.zshrc
bash -n zsh/.functions.sh
bash -n zsh/.aliases.sh

# Run shellcheck on modified scripts
shellcheck your-modified-script.sh

# Test init script (dry run)
# Note: Be careful running init.sh in development
```

---

## Running Tests

### Comprehensive Validation

The repository includes a comprehensive validation suite:

```bash
# Run full validation (recommended before submitting PR)
test-zsh

# Or directly:
./bin/test-zsh-config
```

This validates:

- ✅ All tools and packages are installed
- ✅ Environment variables are set correctly
- ✅ Shell configuration loads without errors
- ✅ Performance metrics (startup time)
- ✅ PATH is configured correctly

### CI/CD Validation

All pull requests are automatically validated through GitHub Actions:

- **Shellcheck**: Validates shell script syntax and best practices
- **shfmt**: Checks shell script formatting
- **JSON validation**: Validates packages.json and config files
- **Security scanning**: Checks for hardcoded paths and secrets
- **macOS testing**: Tests on macOS environment

---

## Code Style

### Shell Scripts

**Formatting**:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Format with `shfmt -i 4 -ci`
- Maximum line length: 120 characters (soft limit)

**Best Practices**:

- Use `#!/bin/zsh` for zsh scripts, `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for bash scripts
- Quote variables: `"$variable"` not `$variable`
- Use `[[ ]]` for conditionals in zsh/bash
- Prefer `local` for function-scoped variables
- Add error handling for critical operations

**Example**:

```bash
#!/bin/zsh

# Good variable usage
my_function() {
    local input="$1"

    if [[ -z "$input" ]]; then
        echo "Error: Input required" >&2
        return 1
    fi

    echo "Processing: $input"
}
```

### Shellcheck Compliance

All shell scripts must pass shellcheck validation:

```bash
# Run shellcheck
shellcheck your-script.sh

# Common exclusions (when justified):
# SC1091 - Can't follow source (for dynamic sourcing)
# SC2039 - In POSIX sh, 'local' is undefined (when using bash/zsh)
```

### Python Scripts

For Python utilities (bin/manage-packages, bin/generate-brewfile):

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Include docstrings for functions
- Use type hints where applicable

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

**Starting from v1.0.0**, this repository adopts [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional change)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build, etc.)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### Scopes (Optional)

Use scopes to indicate which part of the codebase is affected:

- `(init)` - init.sh installation script
- `(zsh)` - Zsh configuration (.zshrc, .aliases.sh, .functions.sh)
- `(ci)` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `(docs)` - Documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- `(packages)` - Package management (packages.json, Brewfile)
- `(security)` - Secret management and security features
- `(prompt)` - Oh My Posh theme configuration
- `(git)` - Git configuration
- `(vim)` - Vim configuration
- `(tmux)` - Tmux configuration

### Examples

**Good commit messages**:

```bash
feat(zsh): add fzf integration for history search

Add fzf keybindings for enhanced history search with Ctrl+R.
Includes fuzzy matching and preview pane.

Closes #123

fix(init): resolve package installation order issue

SDKMAN installation was failing when brew packages weren't installed first.
Reordered installation steps to ensure dependencies are met.

docs(readme): update troubleshooting section

Add solutions for common Oh My Posh font rendering issues.

perf(zsh): optimize NVM lazy loading

Reduce shell startup time from 1.2s to 0.6s by deferring full NVM initialization.

chore(packages): update Homebrew package versions

Bump lazygit to 0.55.1, oh-my-posh to 26.25.0
```

**Bad commit messages** (avoid these):

```bash
Update stuff
Fix bug
WIP
asdf
Minor changes
```

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer or use `!` after type:

```bash
feat(zsh)!: change default shell theme to minimal

BREAKING CHANGE: The default Oh My Posh theme has changed from zen to minimal.
Users can restore the previous theme by setting THEME=zen in .env
```

### Commit Message Template

You can set up a git commit message template:

```bash
# Create template file
cat > ~/.gitmessage << 'EOF'
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# |<----  Using a Maximum Of 50 Characters  ---->|

# Explain why this change is being made
# |<----   Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters   ---->|

# Provide links or keys to any relevant tickets, articles or other resources
# Example: Closes #123

# --- COMMIT END ---
# Type can be:
#   feat     (new feature)
#   fix      (bug fix)
#   docs     (changes to documentation)
#   style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#   refactor (refactoring production code)
#   test     (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
#   chore    (updating build tasks etc; no production code change)
# Scope is optional and can be: init, zsh, ci, docs, packages, security, etc.
# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
EOF

# Configure git to use the template
git config --local commit.template ~/.gitmessage
```

## Adding New Packages

To add a new package to the dotfiles:

### 1. Update packages.json

Add the package to the appropriate category:

```json
{
  "categories": {
    "core": {
      "packages": {
        "your-package": {
          "enabled": true,
          "type": "brew",
          "description": "Description of your package",
          "required": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Regenerate Brewfile

```bash
./bin/generate-brewfile
```

### 3. Update init.sh (if needed)

If the package requires special installation or configuration, update `init.sh`.

### 4. Add to validation suite

Update `bin/test-zsh-config` to validate the new package if it's critical.

### 5. Document in README

Add the package to the relevant section in README.md with usage examples.

### 6. Test installation

Test that the package installs correctly:

```bash
# Clean test
brew install your-package

# Or test full init
./init.sh
```

## Development Tips

### Quick Testing Loop

```bash
# Make changes to config files
vim zsh/.aliases.sh

source ~/.zshrc

# Or create a test function
test_change() {
    source ~/dotfiles/zsh/.aliases.sh
    # Test your changes
}
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Enable zsh debugging
zsh -x

# Test specific file syntax
zsh -n zsh/.zshrc

# Run shellcheck on specific file
shellcheck zsh/.functions.sh

# Profile startup performance
./bin/profile-startup
```

### Useful Git Commands

```bash
# Update from upstream
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
